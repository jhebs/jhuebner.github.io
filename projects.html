 <h3>Summary</h3>
     <h2>Why ShareMe?</h2>
     <h4>.......</h4>

<p style="padding-bottom:2rem">Cloud storage applications is a growing market that people are increasingly reliant on it for both personal and professional use. In 2019 an
  estimated 3.6 billion people worldwide used cloud storage, up from 1.8 billion people in 2017. With so many cloud storage users, there is an
  opportunity for a new, updated product to enter the market that resolves frustrations current users experience.

ShareMe seeks to do this by improving discoverability and giving users the ability to gather all of their photos one, easy-to-use interface.</p>

          <h4>.......</h4>
          <p>For this project, I was tasked with building a cloud storage brand and app that stood out in the
            saturated market. The client did not have a specific vision in mind and was reliant on me to discover
            the problems that existed for current users which the competition had yet to address. The research
            I conducted allowed me to see a pattern of frustrations users experienced when using their cloud storage app of choice:</p>

          <p>ShareMe is a cloud storage app that allows you to share private albums with friends and family.
            Staying organized with our intuitive album system. Always connected with timely alerts and notifications.
            Share private albums where invitees can collaborate by uploading photos, adding comments and tagging other users.<p>

      <p>To discover how to best position ShareMe in the saturated market,
        I needed to first understand the strengths and weakness of the competitors
        that already existed in the space. After doing some research and determining
        Google Photo, Evernote, and Pinterest were three of the most popular, I decided to use them to conduct my competitive analysis.

 <!--USER RESEARCH
    ---------------------------->
    <section class="main-section">

          <h3>User research</h3>
          <h2>Clarifying Users' Expectations & Frustrations</h2>
          <h4>.......</h4>
          <p>I knew going into this project I had to find a niche product. I had to create a product that would bring
            value to the end customer and solve a problem. And while the market is full of cloud storage applications that
            share links, workbooks, etc - I wanted to create a hybrid of a cloud storage application and social media.
            My idea was to create a photo-sharing cloud storage
          application that users can upload photos to one album, tag and add comments with an emphasis on privacy.</p>
          <p>Going into my user survey, and understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of already established companies I was able
            to craft a survey that would help create a flawless product. </p>

     <h1>EVALUATING THE DESIGN</h1>

   <section class="main-section">

     <h3>User Testing</h3>
     <h2>Preference Testing</h2>
     <h4>.......</h4>

     <p>In this phase, I also did a preference testing along with user testing. Preference testing helped me to choose between design variations, by simply asking users which one they prefer. My results: </p>
<ol>
  <li><span style="font-weight:400">Alerts Icon:</span> </li><p>Bell (winner) vs text box for notification in table bar
60% of the participants thought the bell was the most appropriate option based on their experiences with other apps who also use the bell icon. Here is some feedback I received and were echoed with about 4 more participants. I will be adding a +1 on the bell for a complete notification experience.

“I associate the bell icon more with notifications than the text box, which i associate most with messages…”</p>

<li><span style="font-weight:400"> Color of album labels: </span></li><p>White (winner) vs Blue-
This was a landslide with the white labels being the winner at 65%. Which was great since I prefered both colors, but the participants thought the white was more inline with the iOS style “cleaner on the eyes,”  and “Its lighter and cleaner.”</p>
<img src="images/pref3.png" class="responsive">

<li><span style="font-weight:400">Add new album button:</span></li><p>Yellow vs Blue (Winner)-
This was blue button won at 59% for many reasons according to the participants …”this (blue)button is easier to see in terms of contrast, users with vision impairments might have some trouble with the yellow button” - “matches color scheme” and “its in the same
Family”</p>

     <p>In this phase, I also did a preference testing along with user testing. Preference testing helped me to choose between design variations, by simply asking users which one they prefer. My results: </p>
     <ol>
<li>Website wasn’t clear, needed to do another round of changes to content, and spacing. </li>

<li>Updated the modal to a dropdown in album desktop view and  the modals: </li>
<img src="images/us2.png" class="responsive">
<br><br>
<li>Incorporated all of these design changes into my iOS prototype, including taking out the ‘+’ button on the mobile to create a more cohesive experience for the user. Because as I was watching the user in the user feedback, they were confused why it was there and said they would a play around with it, but it wasn’t necessary. </li>

       <h3>In Conclusion</h3>
       <h2>What I Learned</h2>
       <h4>.......</h4>
       <p>This was my first full design project and it was an incredible learning experience. These are the biggest lessons I learned:</p>
<ol>
      <li>ShareMe taught me the importance of testing throughout this design process. Testing allowed for quick iteration and discovery of unidentified problems which resulted in a far more improved final product and inspired a more informed solution between  my mobile and desktop experience. </li>

    <li>Data is always right. I loved how data was and is a huge part of the design process.  Data guided me to create a product for the consumer that was streamless and intuitive. The data disqualified my assumptions, which was such an awesome experience. </li>

    <li>As part of my research, I wish I would have studied the layout and navigation structure of several cloud platforms - while validating design decisions through several rounds of user-testing. I am very new to UX, so it would have been beneficial as I built out my platforms from the sketches to the final clickable prototype. </li>

    <li> Know when to stop. I could keep testing and updating and testing and updating. I feel like this process is never really done. I could continue to grow my skill set, create a more seamless experience, but I have to remember the MVP and know that I could make updates to the product once its published. </li>

</ol>

    <h3>Next Steps</h3>
    <h4>.......</h4>
<p>If given more time, I would test my features of the dashboard. Based on my initial survey results, my original design was for an iOS app, so my main focus was to build out my iOs app. But to ensure an inclusive experience, understanding the hierarchy and spacing of a  polished dashboard would have saved me a lot of time upfront.</p>
